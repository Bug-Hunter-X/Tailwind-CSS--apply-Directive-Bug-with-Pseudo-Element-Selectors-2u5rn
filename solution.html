The solution is to avoid using the `@apply` directive for classes that contain pseudo-element selectors.  Apply these styles directly within the element's class declaration.

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500 hover:before:content-[' ']">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This workaround applies the styles correctly, ensuring that the `::before` pseudo-element is properly styled when the button is hovered.
