This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-element selector (like `::before` or `::after`).  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle these selectors, leading to unexpected styles or no styles being applied at all.

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500 ::before:content-[' ']">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This example intends to add a `::before` pseudo-element to the button when hovered. However, due to this bug, the `::before` styles might not be applied.
